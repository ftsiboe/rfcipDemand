# Introduction
`rfcipDemand` provides tools to construct county‚Äìcrop‚Äìpractice‚Äìplan‚Äìunit panels from the USDA RMA Summary of Business (SOBTPU) and related sources, and to estimate FCIP demand systems with two-way cluster-robust covariance. 

The pipeline standardizes coverage measures, merges price and instrument variables, adds rental-rate and price-index controls, reconciles county acreage (FSA/NASS), and produces diagnostics including robust first-stage F-tests. Methods align with the empirical design in "The crop insurance demand response to premium subsidies Evidence from U.S. Agriculture" (Food Policy, 2023, 119(3))..

**Disclaimer:** This product uses data provided by the USDA, but is not endorsed by or affiliated with USDA or the Federal Government.

See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/ftsiboe/rfcipDemand/blob/main/LICENSE) file in the repository's root for details.

# Installation
`rfcipDemand` can be installed directly from github using 

```{r installation, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Demo-only installation of rfcipCalcPass from GitHub
# (chunk is set eval=FALSE so it will not actually run)
devtools::install_github("ftsiboe/rfcipDemand",force= TRUE,upgrade = "never")
```

# Supported Functionalities


# Examples 

**NOTE:** In all examples we use .  


## Example 1: Calculations for individual-based basic crop insurance plans

This example shows how to calculate **liabilities**, **premiums**, **subsidies**, and **indemnities** using individual-based basic crop insurance plans.

We‚Äôll use sample data for **Producer A**, who grows grain corn in **Adair County, Iowa** during the **2020 crop year**.
