Description: Tools to construct county–crop–practice–plan–unit panels from the
    USDA RMA Summary of Business (SOBTPU) and related sources, and to estimate
    FCIP demand systems with two-way cluster-robust covariance. The pipeline
    standardizes coverage measures, merges price and instrument variables, adds
    rental-rate and price-index controls, reconciles county acreage (FSA/NASS),
    and produces diagnostics including robust first-stage F-tests. Methods align
    with the empirical design in "The crop insurance demand response to premium
    subsidies Evidence from U.S. Agriculture" (Food Policy, 2023, 119(3)).
