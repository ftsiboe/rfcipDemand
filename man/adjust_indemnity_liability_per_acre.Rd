\description{
Compute adjusted liability per acre and adjusted indemnity per acre
when moving from a baseline coverage level to a new level. The method
floors production-to-count at 0 and resolves five mutually exclusive
cases via \code{data.table::fcase()}.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{production_to_count = pmax(baseline_liability_per_acre - baseline_indemnity_per_acre, 0)}
\item \code{adj_Liability_per_acre = (baseline_liability_per_acre / baseline_coverage_level) * coverage_level_percent}
\item Indemnity cases (I1-I5) selected with \code{data.table::fcase()}.
}
