under an alternative premium-per-liability using elasticities of insured
acres and/or coverage level.

\details{
\subsection{Assumptions (set via \code{assumption})}{

\itemize{
\item \code{0}: Fixed demand — both coverage and acres remain at baseline.
\item \code{1}: Acres respond to price (elasticity γ); coverage fixed.
\item \code{2}: Coverage responds to price (elasticity θ); acres fixed.
\item \code{3}: Both acres and coverage respond.
}
}

\subsection{Price response}{

Price response is applied using the percent change in price:
\deqn{\%\Delta p = 100 \times \left(\frac{\text{alt}}{\text{base}} - 1\right),}
and for any baseline quantity \eqn{q} with elasticity \eqn{e_q}:
\deqn{q_{\text{new}} = q_{\text{base}} \left[1 + \left(e_q \times \frac{\%\Delta p}{100}\right)\right].}
}

\subsection{Coverage adjustment}{

Coverage is rounded to the nearest 0.05 grid and truncated to the range
\eqn{(0, 0.85)}. Values less than 0.50 are set to \code{0} (i.e., no
coverage). Coverage type code is set to \code{"A"} for buy-up coverage and
\code{"C"} for CAT coverage. For CAT policies, scenario coverage levels at
0.50/0.55 are adjusted to reflect CAT rules.

Per-acre liability and indemnity are updated using
\code{\link{adjust_indemnity_liability_per_acre}}.
}

\subsection{Optional schedules}{

Coverage-specific scaling is possible via:
\itemize{
\item \code{premium_subsidy_schedule}: length-8 numeric for coverage levels
\code{0.50, 0.55, ..., 0.85}. Multiplies the
\code{baseline_subsidy_per_premium} at the scenario coverage.
\item \code{rate_differential_schedule}: length-8 numeric for the same grid.
Multiplies the \code{alternate_premium_per_liability} at the scenario coverage.
}
}

\subsection{Missing or zero inputs}{

If either \code{insured_acres} or \code{coverage_level_percent} is \code{NA}
or \code{0} after adjustment, both are reset to \code{0} and all dollar
outcomes are set to \code{0}.

Elasticities are applied multiplicatively to baseline quantities. Coverage
levels are snapped to the 0.05 grid and truncated. When schedules are
supplied, subsidy shares and premium rates are rescaled relative to the
baseline coverage before applying to the scenario coverage.
