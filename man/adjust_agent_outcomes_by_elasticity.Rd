\description{
Simulate FCIP outcomes (coverage level, insured acres, liability, premium,
subsidy, and indemnity) under an alternative premium-per-liability, using
elasticities for insured acres and/or coverage level.
}
\details{
Assumptions:
\itemize{
\item \code{0} - Fixed demand (coverage and acres stay at baseline).
\item \code{1} - Acres respond to price (gamma), coverage fixed.
\item \code{2} - Coverage responds to price (theta), acres fixed.
\item \code{3} - Both acres and coverage respond.
}

Price response uses percent change in price:
\deqn{\% \Delta p = 100 \times \left(\frac{\text{alt}}{\text{base}} - 1\right).}

Coverage adjustments are rounded to 0.05 increments and truncated to [0, 0.85]
(values < 0.5 set to 0). Per-acre liability/indemnity are updated via
\code{adjust_indemnity_liability_per_acre()}.
