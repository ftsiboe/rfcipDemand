\title{rfcipDemand: Estimate Federal Crop Insurance Program Demand Models}
\description{
Tools to construct county–crop–practice–plan–unit panels from the USDA RMA Summary of Business (SOBTPU) and related sources, and to estimate FCIP demand systems with two-way cluster-robust covariance. The pipeline standardizes coverage measures, merges price and instrument variables, adds rental-rate and price-index controls, reconciles county acreage (FSA/NASS), and produces diagnostics including robust first-stage F-tests. Methods align with the empirical design in "The crop insurance demand response to premium subsidies Evidence from U.S. Agriculture" (Food Policy, 2023, 119(3)).
